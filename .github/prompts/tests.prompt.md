description: Add meaningful behavioral, failure, and regression coverage
---

Add focused tests that verify the requested behavior and its relevant failure paths.

Follow [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and the engineering standards for
[testing](../../docs/ENGINEERING.md#testing).

- Test changed behavior and meaningful boundaries/failures; avoid tests that mirror
  internals or a mechanical matrix with no implementation consequence.
- Keep tests deterministic and isolated; use bounded readiness checks. Select
  privileged/hardware runs explicitly through the approved path.
- Reuse established baseline results. Hardware runs should verify changed Rust
  behavior or reproducibility. Report actual workload results and material gaps.
- For native adapter ports, cover identity/access/provider errors, stale state,
  verified no-op, deadlines and uncertain mutation as applicable. Compare affected
  observable results with the working baseline; passing the existing PowerShell
  adapter tests alone does not qualify its Rust replacement.
- Use small variable-size provisioning fixtures for enumeration, mapping,
  deduplication/collisions, missing files, hashes and manifest validation. Label
  historical driver regression fixtures; their count is not a product acceptance gate.

GPU-PV feasibility is established; implement and validate the product for an
existing selected VM. Reuse disposable-VM tooling for tests. Golden-image copying,
cloning, disk reset and laboratory setup stay outside the production path unless
an explicit user-facing roadmap task requires them. Test tooling may depend on
product code; product code must not depend on test tooling.

The user-approved architecture rebase takes precedence over historical task scope.
Use runtime existing-VM identities and the revised core → native GUI → allocation/
vendor roadmap. Old fixed-slot code is research/contributor tooling in `tools/lab/`.
Do not preserve laboratory coupling, baseline driver pins or repeated diagnosis as
product architecture. Default operation verifies health plus checked graphics;
extended CUDA/stress remain optional. The core never imports the laboratory.

## Testing Policy — Codex

Stop running tests, builds, compilation checks, or launching the UI after every small change.

Follow these rules:

1. **During development:** Make changes without automatically running tests, `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo build`, or launching the GUI.
2. **At milestone completion:** Run relevant tests and build checks once, after all work for that milestone is complete.
3. **On explicit request:** Run tests whenever I specifically instruct you to.
4. **Small changes:** Do not test individual edits, UI adjustments, layout changes, refactoring, or documentation updates.
5. **Failures:** If a milestone test fails, fix the relevant issue and rerun only the necessary checks. Avoid repeatedly running the entire test suite.
6. **Exceptions:** If you believe immediate testing is essential, explain why and request permission first.

Prioritise implementing the planned work over repeatedly validating intermediate states.

**Important:** Do not interpret completing an individual task or subtask as completing a milestone. A milestone is complete only when all its planned tasks are finished.

At the end of each task, briefly report what changed and whether it remains untested. Do not automatically start validation.

This policy overrides existing instructions to test continuously unless I explicitly tell you otherwise.
